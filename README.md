# Final Program - CRT Deflection Plates Game

Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) are vacuum tubes that produce images by use of electron beams and a phospherescent screen. This is done by manipulation of the electron beams so that it strikes certain spots on the screen creating luminous spots.

The source of the electron beams is the electron gun, which contains the hater, cathode, control grid, and anodes. The cathode is cylindrical and contains a layer of strontium and barium oxide which emits the electrons at the end of the tube. These electrons pass through the control grid and continue to pass through the anodes which help focus the beams.

Electrons eventually reach the deflecting plates which send the electron into certain areas of the fluorescent screen, which is used to create an image on the screen.


The goal of this program is to model the manipulation of electrons using deflection plates similar to a CRT.

The program will contain a target and let players try to hit the target with the electron by adjusting the magnetic field of the deflection plates.


NOTE: This program works best when ran outside of the Jupyter Notebook, because of the keyboard controls.
